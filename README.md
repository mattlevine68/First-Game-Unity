# First-Game-Unity
Designing my first 3D game using unity 

Practice Unity - Simple cube runner to understand basics of physics, connecting Levels and other basic Unity components
                 Only have a build for Macs to run downoload repo and open build folder in Finder
                 
Dice Game - One page canvas to understand saving and deleting states (Highscore and Reset) didn't bother to make a build since
            it's just a canvas
